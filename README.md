# Entropy Engine

Is it a game engine? A video engine? Entropy can do many things.

Powering a unified OS inspired by MCP.

- Quadtree landscapes with texture maps
- Point lighting
- Game behaviors
- Kinematic animations
- Rendered images and videos
- Rendered text with fonts
- Screen capture
- Vector animations
- Video export
- GLB Import
- Interactive, windy, procedural grass blades
- and more!

TBD:

- Paralax Mapping?
- Tessellation?
- Displacement Mapping?
