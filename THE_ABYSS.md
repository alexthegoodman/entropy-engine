# The Abyss

## Story

In The Abyss (FPS RPG), an energy-obsessed, highly-advanced surface people drill deep into their planet in search of more energy. They accidentally breach and destroy a large pocket of magical energy which has been the source of religion and magical power to a hidden, underground civilization for millenia. War ensues for 1000 years. There’s a brief 21-day ceasefire early on the war because both sides realized that mutal annihilation was innevitable. After the ceasefire, they nearly did annihilate each other, but kept on fighting even as civilization on both sides deteriorated into bits and pieces. This first game in the series starts 224 years into the war. The first chapter of this game begins at the legendary Meeting Place, where the ceasefire was ratified nearly 200 years previous. Now it is in ruins, and overrun with hostiles. There is however a weapon cache inside the large Meeting Dome, which includes surface weapons and magical ones. The player can use both weapon types.

The first character you play as is a rogue. He was raised by a surface mechanic who had a child with an underground mage. A very rare and dangerous thing to have happen, but sometimes it does. He is raised by his father on the surface. Then he eventually ventures off to the underground to understand his past. The story starts some years after that, at the Meeting Place. You begin lightly armed and stocked, but need to find more items and weapons soon, because there are so many hostiles everywhere.
