# Entropy Engine

entropy-engine is essentially a mixture of midpoint-engine (game engine) and stunts-engine (video engine) in a unified codebase. It has landscapes, video, text, images, 3d models, lighting, and more.

Ultimately, this engine will power separate editor's used for different purposes, and will even power a chat UI which enables the user to do things via chat similar to MCP but without the hassle of MCP setup processes.
